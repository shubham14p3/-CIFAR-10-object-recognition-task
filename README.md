# CIFAR-10 using CNNs

This project aims to predict the labels of the CIFAR-10 datset. This project uses Keras to implement deep learning. Almost all the code is in the form of IPython notebooks.
Final accuracy - [87.94%]

## Dependencies

* Jupyter 
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Matplotlib
* Pickle

## Contents

1. Helper - Helper functions which decode and fetch the data to the IPython notebooks
2. Basic - IPython notebook to test helper functions and list images in the dataset
3. Simple CNN - IPython notebook with a simple implementation of CNN taken from the Keras examples
4. Improved CNN - IPython notebook which uses a pure CNN network with image augmentations to implove the accuracy of the model
5. Model files (.h5) - Different saved models
